(* P10 Run-length encoding of a list.
    Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method. Consecutive duplicates of elements are encoded as tuples (N, E) where N is the number of duplicates of the element E.

    Example:

    scala> encode(List('a, 'a, 'a, 'a, 'b, 'c, 'c, 'a, 'a, 'd, 'e, 'e, 'e, 'e))
    res0: List[(Int, Symbol)] = List((4,'a), (1,'b), (2,'c), (2,'a), (1,'d), (4,'e)) *)

use "p09.sml";

fun encode xs = foldl (fn(x,acc) => case x of
        x'::_ => acc@[(length x, x')] 
      | [] => acc) [] (pack(xs))
